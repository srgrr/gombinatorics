# Gombinatorics üé≤

A goroutine-friendly combinatorics/functional library. It features methods like cartesian product for slices but by *generating* them on demand and channeling the results as you go.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Friendly Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è
This library is still WIP. It started as a side-quest for something I'm working on.

Immediate TODOs:
- Add `IFunctions` accepting channels, so they can also take *generators*

# Example

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
	sets "github.com/srgrr/gombinatorics/sets"
)

func sendSpam(user string, spam string, wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
	defer wg.Done()
	fmt.Printf("Sent spam\t\"%s\"\t to %s,\thope they will buy my stuff!\n", spam, user)
}

func main() {
	emails := []string{"sergio@raccoon.me", "raquel@cat.me"}
	spam := []string{"Raccoon plushies now 10% discount", "Brown hair dye now 5% discount"}
	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	for emailAndSpam := range sets.CartesianProduct(emails, spam) {
		wg.Add(1)
		go sendSpam(emailAndSpam.First, emailAndSpam.Second, &wg)
	}
	wg.Wait()
}
```
